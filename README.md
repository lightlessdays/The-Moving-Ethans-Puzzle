# The Moving Ethans Puzzle

Ethan is a pre-defined third person character in Unity that can perform numerous actions. In our gameplay, we will make the population of Ethans perform numerous actions randomly. These include:
1. Moving Forward
2. Moving Backward
3. Moving Left
4. Moving Right
5. Jumping
6. Crouching

Now, our goal is to design a genetic algorithm that will make a generation of Ethans travel the maximum distance on a strip by performing any one of the actions.
